= WIP Contionus Delivery

== What is - Continuous Integration (CI)

Frequently committing small releasable changes to master/main which are
verified on push

1. Small releasable commits
2. Push to master/main
3. CI Runs
   ** Pass Linting
   ** Pass Tests
   ** Build image

=== Why - Continuous Integration

- Work in smaller steps (Less waste)
- Avoid big merge conflicts
- Early commits allows other devs to build upon changes

== What is - Continuous deployment

Automate deployment on every commit

== Why - Continuous deployment

- Manually deploying is error prone and time consuming
- Safer deployments
  - Blue Green deployments
  - Canary deployments
- Deployment as code (No documentation/context)

== What is - Continuous delivery (CD)

`continuous integration + continuous deployment = continuous delivery`

=== Why - Continuous delivery

- Quickly and easily deploying new features/fixes for faster feedback
- Less risky than a big deployment

== How

- Always releasable
  ** Small commits to master that pass linting and tests
- Automate builds
  ** Build script that run automatically (e.g. after each commit, new tag)
- Build as code
  ** Build scripts in version control
- Use CD service
  ** Runs on build server
- Ephemeral environments
  ** Fresh build environment and image each run. (Avoid persisted state)

== DORA metrics

- Velocity
  ** Deployment frequency (Multiple times a day)
  ** Lead time (commit -> production) is less than an hour
- Stability
  ** Time to restore service (< One hour)
    *** Roll back on breaking release
    *** Blue green deployments
    *** Canary deployments
  ** Change failure rate (< 15%)
