== TL;DR Debugging

- Apply the scientific method in small steps, writing down your experiments
- Breakdown and simplify the problem.
- (Rich Hickey) - Father Wattson's questions
  - Where are you at?
  - Where are you going?
  - What do you know?
  - What do you need to know?

== Contents

== Mindset

<img align="right" src="/sherlock-holmes.png">

Having the right mindset

- There is always a logical explanation
- Being stuck is only temporary
- Timebox
- Priortise
  - An unlikely bug with little consequence doesn't need to be fixed right away

== 1. Failure

Something isn't working as expected.

=== ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ STATE THE PROBLEM ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

> If you don't know where you are going, you might wind up someplace else

<img align="right" src="/writing.png">

- Write down your understanding and improve as you go along
  Does your explanation cover every point
- Iterative process
  - Progressively ask less stupid questions
- Feynman technique
  - Explaining the problem to a rubber duck helps find the gaps in your understanding
  - Talk to Pair
- Deductive reasoning (Suduku)
  - What do we know? (Constraints, Facts)
  - What do we need to know?
    - What is `x`?
    - Does `y` work how I expect?

=== Skepticism

Be skeptical of what's presented to you

```text
"There were no footmarks" - Man
"Meaing that you saw none?" - Sherlock
```

> The error occurs on Cassandra but not H2

Don't take their word for it test it.
Write a test that performs the problematic query on both databases so
there are no other dependencies.

You discover the problem was a miscommunication problem,
reproducing the issue showed the problem occurred on both databases

=== Sequence of events

<img align="right" src="/sequence.png">

- ðŸ”¥ Map the sequence of events that lead to bug
  - Draw it
    - Sequence (Backed with logs)
    - Network
    - State
- What did you/they expect compared to what happened?
  - Analyse the evidence
    - Get a screen recording/screenshot
    - Read the logs/stack trace **carefully!!!**
    - Check the database/event feed/queue
- Check recent commits (Git bisect)

=== Can you reproduce the bug?

- Reproducing the bug means you can control each variable while you experiment
- Create a smaller program with the same bug so you have fewer variables and a
  quicker feedback loop

=== Print statements

<img align="right" src="/pressure.png">

Just like gauges in mechanical systems, add instrumentation to
your system so you can see what happening

```clojure
;; Example using weavejester/hashp

(defn n 24)

(defn foo
      [n]
      (cond =p (> n 40) =p (+ n 20)
            =p (> n 20) =p (- (first n) 20)
            :else =p 0))

(foo n)

;; (> n 40) -> false
;; (+ n 20) -> 44
;; (> n 20) -> true
;; (- (first n) 20) -> Exception
;; 0 -> 0
```

Or better yet just evaluate each expression in the REPL

=== Research

<img align="right" src="/user-guide.png">

- RTFM
- Google
- Retrace from the line that failed and work backward on what may have led
  to the cause
- Compare with a working example from the project docs

```clojure
(def partial-join (partial (clojure.string/join ",")))

(partial-join ["foo" "bar"])
; => Exception!
```

String join docs

```text
(join coll) (join separator coll)

Returns a string of all elements in coll, as returned by (seq coll),
 separated by an optional separator.
```

Only passing `","` `to Clojure`.`string/join` uses the single arity function

== 2. Hypothesis (Cause)

A proposed explanation made based on **limited evidence** as
a **starting point** for further investigation

Cause mapping (N whys). More than one reason why something happened.

An event preceding an effect without which the effect would not have occurred

<img align="right" src="/think.png">

- ðŸ”¥ Write down your hypothesises
- Include silly ideas
- Prioritise
- Hammock time
- Only move forward when you have enough data

=== Hypothesis Example

```clojure
(def partial-join (partial (clojure.string/join ",")))

(partial-join ["foo" "bar"])
; => Exception!
```

- `string/join` doesn't do what I want
- `partial` doesn't do what I want
- `def` doesn't do what I want

== 3. Experiment

1. Reproducible
2. Driven by hypothesis
3. Small
4. Change only one thing

<img align="right" src="/experiment.png">

- ðŸ”¥ **Write down your experiments**
  - What variable did you test?
  - What did you expect? What was the actual result?
  - Why does the experiment make sense?
- Short feedback loop
  - REPL
  - Unit test
  - Try good and bad inputs to demonstrate the defect

== 4. Observation

1. Understand all the outputs
   1. Don't know the output? How do you know if it's related to the problem or not
2. Suspect correlations
   1. But in the last 5 lines
3. Use good tools (More outputs)
   1. Debuggers, Logging, Print, Metrics

<img align="right" src="/report.png">

- IF experiment supports hypothesis
- THEN refine the hypothesis or diagnose
- ELSE reject hypothesis

== 5. Theory (Diagnosis)

<img align="right" src="/lightbulb.png">

- A hypothesis offering valid predictions that can be observed
- Blog/tell a friend what you learned
- Does theory cover all of your problems
- Take a break

=== Tools

- Debugger
- Profilers - perf
- Tracers - strace
- Network spy - ngrep
