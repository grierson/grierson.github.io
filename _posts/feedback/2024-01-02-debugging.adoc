== TL;DR

- Apply the scientific method in small steps, writing down your experiments
- Breakdown and simplify the problem.
- (Rich Hickey) - Father Wattson's questions
  - Where are you at?
  - Where are you going?
  - What do you know?
  - What do you need to know?

== Mindset

image::sherlock-holmes.png[]

Having the right mindset

- There is always a logical explanation
- Being stuck is only temporary
- Timebox
- Priortise
  - An unlikely bug with little consequence doesn't need to be fixed right away

== 1. Failure

Something isn't working as expected.

=== ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ STATE THE PROBLEM ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

[quote, Yogi Berra]
If you don't know where you are going, you might wind up someplace else.

image::writing.png[]

- Write down your understanding and improve as you go along
  Does your explanation cover every point
- Iterative process
  - Progressively ask less stupid questions
- Feynman technique
  - Explaining the problem to a rubber duck helps find the gaps in your understanding
  - Talk to Pair
- Deductive reasoning (Suduku)
  - What do we know? (Constraints, Facts)
  - What do we need to know?
    - What is `x`?
    - Does `y` work how I expect?

=== Skepticism

Be skeptical of what's presented to you

```text
"There were no footmarks" - Man
"Meaing that you saw none?" - Sherlock
```

> The error occurs on Cassandra but not H2

Don't take their word for it test it.
Write a test that performs the problematic query on both databases so
there are no other dependencies.

You discover the problem was a miscommunication problem,
reproducing the issue showed the problem occurred on both databases

=== Sequence of events

image::sequence.png[]

- ðŸ”¥ Map the sequence of events that lead to bug
  ** Draw it
    *** Sequence (Backed with logs)
    *** Network
    *** State
- What did you/they expect compared to what happened?
  ** Analyse the evidence
    *** Get a screen recording/screenshot
    *** Read the logs/stack trace **carefully!!!**
    *** Check the database/event feed/queue
- Check recent commits (Git bisect)

=== Can you reproduce the bug?

- Reproducing the bug means you can control each variable while you experiment
- Create a smaller program with the same bug so you have fewer variables and a
  quicker feedback loop

=== Print statements

image::pressure.png[]

Just like gauges in mechanical systems, add instrumentation to
your system so you can see what happening

```clojure
;; Example using weavejester/hashp

(defn n 24)

(defn foo
      [n]
      (cond #p (> n 40) #p (+ n 20)
            #p (> n 20) #p (- (first n) 20)
            :else #p 0))

(foo n)

;; (> n 40) -> false
;; (+ n 20) -> 44
;; (> n 20) -> true
;; (- (first n) 20) -> Exception
;; 0 -> 0
```

Or better yet just evaluate each expression in the REPL

=== Research

image::user-guide.png[]

- RTFM
- Google
- Retrace from the line that failed and work backward on what may have led
  to the cause
- Compare with a working example from the project docs

```clojure
(def partial-join (partial (clojure.string/join ",")))

(partial-join ["foo" "bar"])
; => Exception!
```

String join docs

```text
(join coll) (join separator coll)

Returns a string of all elements in coll, as returned by (seq coll),
 separated by an optional separator.
```

Only passing `","` `to Clojure`.`string/join` uses the single arity function

== 2. Hypothesis (Cause)

A proposed explanation made based on **limited evidence** as
a **starting point** for further investigation

Cause mapping (N whys). More than one reason why something happened.

An event preceding an effect without which the effect would not have occurred

image::think.png[]

- ðŸ”¥ Write down your hypothesises
- Include silly ideas
- Prioritise
- Hammock time
- Only move forward when you have enough data

=== Hypothesis Example

```clojure
(def partial-join (partial (clojure.string/join ",")))

(partial-join ["foo" "bar"])
; => Exception!
```

- `string/join` doesn't do what I want
- `partial` doesn't do what I want
- `def` doesn't do what I want

== 3. Experiment

1. Reproducible
2. Driven by hypothesis
3. Small
4. Change only one thing

image::experiment.png[]

- ðŸ”¥ **Write down your experiments**
  ** What variable did you test?
  ** What did you expect? What was the actual result?
  ** Why does the experiment make sense?
- Short feedback loop
  ** REPL
  ** Unit test
  ** Try good and bad inputs to demonstrate the defect

== 4. Observation

image::report.png[]

1. Understand all the outputs
   ** Don't know the output? How do you know if it's related to the problem or not
2. Suspect correlations
   ** But in the last 5 lines
3. Use good tools (More outputs)
   ** Debuggers, Logging, Print, Metrics

- IF experiment supports hypothesis
- THEN refine the hypothesis or diagnose
- ELSE reject hypothesis

== 5. Theory (Diagnosis)

image::lightbulb.png[]

- A hypothesis offering valid predictions that can be observed
- Blog/tell a friend what you learned
- Does theory cover all of your problems
- Take a break

=== Tools

- Debugger
- Profilers - perf
- Tracers - strace
- Network spy - ngrep
