[quote, Yogi Berra]
If you don't know where you are going, you might wind up someplace else.

- Apply the scientific method in small steps, writing down your experiments
- Work iteratively, and move forward in small steps
- Breakdown and simplify the problem.
- (Rich Hickey) - Father Wattson's questions
  ** Where are you at?
  ** Where are you going?
  ** What do you know?
  ** What do you need to know?
