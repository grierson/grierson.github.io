= Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)

[quote,https://htmx.org/essays/hateoas]
A REST client needs little to no prior knowledge about how to interact with an application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia.
The restrictions imposed by HATEOAS decouples client and server.
This enables server functionality to evolve independently.

To demonstate what that means I've created a strawman bank account response to demonstrate the benefits of HATEOAS.

```json
// Non-Hypermedia Bank account response
{
  "cardId": 123,
  "balance" 100,
}
```

== Location transparency

ðŸ¤” **Problem**: I would like to withdraw from my bank account

So I check the API documentation (Swagger) and hard-code the URL into my client.

[source,clojure]
----
(defn withdraw [accountId]
  (http/post "http://www.bank.com/account/" accountId "/withdraw"))
----

[WARNING]
====
This **couples** the client and server as the URL is hard coded into the client
====

So if the address changed for example to a new `v2` endpoint.
Then you need to go into your client again, update the URL, and redeploy.

This is avoided when using `HATEOAS` as the server tell your client what the correct address is.

[source,json]
----
// HATEOAS Bank account response
{
  ...
  "_links": {
    "withdraw": "http://www.bank.com/account/123/withdraw"
  }
}
----

Then in our client we just call `POST` on the `withdraw` link.

[source,clojure]
----
(defn withdraw [accountId]
  (let [discovery (http/get "http://www.bank.com")]
    (http/post (get-in discovery [:_links :withdraw]))))
----

It doesnâ€™t matter if the URL changes like in the `v2` example above as weâ€™ve added a layer of indirection via the links and having the server tell the client the url.

== Resource references

ðŸ¤” **Problem**: What does `cardId` refer to?

Say we need to create a new `Payment service` that has a `/payment` resource that requires a `card` to check the balance.

A naive implementation would be to have the `/payment` resource take a `cardId`

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| /payment request
| /payment handler
a|
[source, json]
----
{
  "card": 123
  ...
}
----

a|
[source, clojure]
----
(defn payment-resource [request]
  (let [card-id (:cardId request)
        card-url (str "http://www.bank.com/cards/" cardId)
        card (http/GET card-url)]
    (> 0 (:balance card))))
----
|===

[WARNING]
====
However this would cause the `Location transparency` issue if the URL changed.
====

Instead having `/payment` accept a `card url` to discover the `card` allows for the card location to change in the future.

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| /payment request
| /payment handler
a|
[source,json]
----
{
  "card": "http://www.bank.com/cards/123"
}
----

a|
[source,clojure]
----
; HATEOAS Bank payment client
(defn payment-resource [request]
  (let [card-url (:card request)
        card (http/GET card-url)]
    (> 0 (:balance card))))
----
|===

It also allows different resources to be passed into the `/payment` resource as long as it contains a `balance` property. 
So, we could support a new `crypto` resource in the future as long as it returns a balance property.

[source,json]
----
{
  "card": "http://www.bank.com/v2/crypto/123"
}
----

== Hypermedia controls

ðŸ¤” **Problem**: Should I be able to withdraw?

If my account balance is 0 should I be able to withdraw? Probably not.
So we add withdrawal conditional logic to our client to prevent making bad requests.

[source,javascript]
----
if (response.balance > 0) return <button>withdraw</button>
----

[WARNING]
====
This creates **coupling**  as the client needs to know about withdrawal conditional logic
====

What happens if business rules change and users can now withdraw into overdrafts?
If you have multiple clients, this problem only multiplies, as they all need to be updated to support the new business rule.

Instead, with HATEOAS, we return links (actions) you can perform on the resource.
Simplifying UIs by moving all conditional logic onto the server side so clients don't have to implement.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| HATEOAS Account zero balance
| HATEOAS Account with balance
a|
[source,json]
----
{
  "balance": 0,
  "_links": {
    "deposit:" "/deposit/123"
  }
}
----

a|
[source,json]
----
{
  "balance": 100,
  "_links": {
    "deposit:" "/deposit/456",
    "withdraw:" "/withdraw/456"
  }
}
----
|===

Then within our client we can just check if the link exists.

[sourcs,javascript]
----
if (hateos/has-link response "withdraw") return <button>withdraw</button>
----

So, if we had the exact business requirement changes as before, allowing users to go into overdrafts.
Then, it's all handled on the server side, allowing the conditional logic to change in the future without client changes.
The new response would look like this, and there would be no need to make any changes to clients.

[sourcs,json]
----
{
  "balance": 0,
  "_links": {
    "deposit:" "/deposit/123"
    "withdraw:" "/withdraw/123"
  }
}
----
