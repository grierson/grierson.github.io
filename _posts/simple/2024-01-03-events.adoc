== What is an event?

An event is a notification that something has happened.
It is a record of an action that has taken place.
A fact.

== Resilience

[WARNING]
====
What happens if any of these steps fail? As `place order`, `payment`, `ship`, or `send confirmation` could all fail.

| What happens if sending the `email confirmation` fails? Do we retry?
If we did then our system would have multiple `placed orders`, the customer would be `charged` twice, and we would `ship` multiple orders.
Can we isolate each step from each other so that they can be retried independently?

        ae --> B
        B --> be[Payment Processed]
        be --> C
        C --> ce[Order Shipped]
        ce --> D
        D --> de[Email Sent]
    end

a| Instead if we used `events` to communicate we isolate each step from each other, basically creating save points between each step.
Now if the `email confirmation` fails we can retry from the `order shipped` event and retry sending the email again.
|===

== Extensibility

Now say we to add a referal programme and apply a `finders fee` for each purchase.
Currently we would need to update and reploy our current implementation

    end

        (place-order)
        (process-payment)

            (finder-fee))
        (send-email)))

        B --> be[Payment Processed]
        be --> C
        be --> D[Finders Fee]
    end
----
a| By using `events` we can extend our system without changing our current implementation.
We can add a new `finder's fee` step that subscribes to the `payment processed` event.
|===

== Scalability

It also allows us to scale each step independently.
The current implementation requires scaling vertically whereas with `events` we can scale horizontally.
So for example if the `process payment` step is slow we can scale that independently.
